# Tetris
A small game project made to showcase my React skills.


# To Do (Currently Working ON)

### Grid
    Should make a nested array for objects where we can store what boxes should be filled.


### Falling Blocks
    So if any of the boxes of the block try to go past the end of the grid they should be stopped.

    Current block will be updated to none.
    
    Then new block will be generated.

### Movement
    Pressing left and right keys will change direction
    
    Pressing up key will change block rotation
