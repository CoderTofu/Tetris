# Tetris
A small game project I made to showcase my React skills.

# February 22, 2022
The project would now be regarded as done function wise.

The game is complete with multitudes of functions one could expect in a tetris game.

# What I learned
Planning the project and how it works matters a lot.

Its better to think ahead of future developments instead of getting stuck by a problem because of a build issue.
